Here are the tutorial notes written by Anna Ly and Ting Lin for [STA260](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/sta260h5) during the summer 2024 semester. Although it's called "Probability and Statistics II", a more appropriate name would be "an introduction to mathematical statistics" based off of the course description, content, and textbook used.

The instructor was [Luai Al Labadi](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=DIin_xEAAAAJ&hl=en) and we followed the Mathematical Statistics with Applications (7th Edition) by Dennis Wackerly, William Mendenhall, and Richard L. Scheaffer.

Some questions were picked from past tests and exams from varying instructors and are high in difficulty.

## Tutorial 1

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial1.pdf)

Interesting remark (a good question that a student had from tutorial.)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial1/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial1/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial1/Question3.pdf)

## Tutorial 2

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial2.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial2/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial2/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial2/Question3.pdf) ✦ [Q4](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial2/Question4.pdf)

There is an issue with the answer for Q3; you're not supposed to claim:

$$
2X \sim \chi^{2}_{(2)} \Rightarrow X \sim \frac{\chi^{2}_{(2)}}{2}
$$

Instead, what happens is:

$$
\frac{2X}{2Y} = \frac{X/2}{Y/2} = \frac{\chi^{2}_{(2)}/2}{\chi^{2}_{(2)}/2} = F(2,2)
$$

## Tutorial 3

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial3.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial3/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial3/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial3/Question3.pdf) ✦ [Q4](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial3/Question4.pdf)

## Tutorial 4

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial4.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial4/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial4/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial4/Question3.pdf)

The reason for picking $a = 0.02$ is because you are focusing on the support of $w$, which is $0 < w < 1$. If you were to pick $a > 1$, then $P(W \leq a) = F_{W}(a) = 1$, which does not provide what we want.

A common question is that when using the table of values for the $Z, \chi^{2}_{n}, t_{v}, F_{n_{1}, n_{2}}$ distributions, we typically assume $(\alpha/2)$ for the area to the right (upper-tail), whereas when directly computing from the cumulative distribution function we assume $(1 - \alpha/2)$ for the right (upper-tail). The reason for this is because the definition of the cumulative distribution directly implies to use the values to the left (lower-tail):

$$
1-\alpha/2 = P(X \leq x) = F_{X}(x)
$$

Whereas the textbook provides upper-tail values for the $Z, \chi^{2}_{n}, t_{v}, F_{n_{1}, n_{2}}$ distributions. Some other textbooks tend to be consistent with the cumulative distribution function.

If you're coding, R is consistent with the cumulative distributions functions.

## Tutorial 5

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial5.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial5/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial5/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial5/Question3.pdf)

## Tutorial 6

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial6.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial6/Question1.pdf) ✦ Q2 [Solution 1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial6/Question2-1.pdf) \| [Solution 2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial6/Question2-2.pdf) ✦ Q3 [Solution 1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial6/Question3-1.pdf) \| [Solution 2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial6/Question3-2.pdf)

There is a rendering issue for the second solution of question 3... The question is the same in the worksheet regardless.

## Tutorial 7

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial7.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial7/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial7/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial7/Question3.pdf) ✦ [Q4](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial7/Question4.pdf)

There is a slight typo for question 2. It should be: $$
\frac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt = f(x)
$$

Instead of $= h(x)$ when reciting the fundamental theorem of calculus.

## Tutorial 8

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial8.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial8/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial8/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial8/Question3.pdf) ✦ [Q4](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial8/Question4.pdf)

There is a small typo in the worksheet; the Fisher's Information is:

$$
I_{n}(\theta) = n I(\theta) = n \left( -\mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial^{2}\theta} \ln(f_{Y}(y|\theta)) \right] \right)
$$

Here, we use the partial derivative: $\partial$, not the univariate derivative $d$. These are not the same (I am not trying to get killed by a mathematician.)

## Tutorial 9

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial9.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial9/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial9/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial9/Question3.pdf)

## Tutorial 10

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial10.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial10/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial10/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial10/Question3.pdf)

There is a typo for the final solution of the second question because $\sigma^{2}$ should be 9, not 3. Hence, you would need to multiply the last value in the rejection region by 9.

## Tutorial 11 & 12

This tutorial was for final exam review.

[Worksheet](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Worksheets/Tutorial11.pdf)

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial11/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial11/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial11/Question3.pdf) ✦ [Q4](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial11/Question4.pdf) ✦ [Q5](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Tutorial11/Question5.pdf)

## Cancelled Tutorial

Previous iterations of the course tend to cover simple linear regression. However, during this semester there was not enough time to cover this. It is typically re-taught in STA302. Nonetheless, the worksheets are posted here for reference.

Solutions: [Q1](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Cancelled/Question1.pdf) ✦ [Q2](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Cancelled/Question2.pdf) ✦ [Q3](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Cancelled/Question3.pdf) ✦ [Q4](assets/STA260/Summer2024/Solutions/Cancelled/Question4.pdf)

## Additional Guides

These are some additional notes that may be useful for students.

### Review Sheet

Below is a formula sheet that was created for the final exam during the winter 2022 session. However, these were not provided for STA260 summer 2022 final exam. Nonetheless, this is a good summary of most equations/formulas you should know before the term tests and exams.

[STA260 Formula/Review Sheet](assets/STA260/STA260Formula.pdf)

### Textbook Solution Manual

There's a public solution manual [found here](https://usermanual.wiki/Document/SolutionManualMathematicalStatisticsWithApplications7thEditionWackerly.313163145/view).

Warnings:

-   This is not an official solution manuals, and there are plenty of typos.

-   Many solutions only make sense if you understand the course material; they do not go in depth. If you wrote their solutions, word-for-word on an assessment, it is unlikely for you to receive full marks.

-   It is pretty good at providing directions if you're lost.

### Guides for Using Statistical Tables

These are guides for using the statistical tables located in Mathematical Statistics with Applications (7th Edition).
