## My Story

::: {style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;"}
::: {style="flex: 1;"}
My name is Anna Ly, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at McMaster University. I am honored to be a recipient of both the Ontario Graduate Scholarship and the Milos Novotny Fellowship. I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto.

Since childhood, I have always been interested in probability and data visualization. I vividly recall the excitement of using crayons to colour bar plots, and that is when I knew statistics and I were a dynamic duo.

I also challenged my family's love for lotteries. Even back then, I had a sense of the gambler's fallacy and understood that casinos were not in the business of giving money away, but I could not prove it.

As an undergraduate student, I have received the privilege to be a teaching assistant for an introductory probability course. I shared how to compute probabilities and expected values of winning a Lotto 649 jackpot. Unfortunately, I still can't convince my father. :)

I love studying statistics because it allows me to comprehend the results of many studies without being an expert! Unlike previous generations, we live in a world where data and information are easily accessible, yet opinions formed without statistical evidence prevail. Conversely, I shape my perspectives similarly to a Bayesian model: I maintain prior beliefs but am always eager to adapt and refine them in the face of compelling evidence.

I am passionate about teaching statistics because I recognize the importance of a supportive teaching assistant. I've always been inspired by those who guide their students with understanding and without judgment. I am deeply grateful for the effective educators who have positively influenced my academic journey.

## Academic Interests

I'm briefly interested in the following branches of statistics:

-   [Nonparametric Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics)

-   [Statistical Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory)

-   [Computational Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics)

I currently don't know what my thesis is going to be about. I just started graduate school!

## Fun Facts About Me

In this section you'll learn that I have a life outside of studying and teaching statistics. (The horror, I know.)

-   I used to doodle all of the time; I hope to get back to drawing.

-   I love reading webcomics. One of my favourite series is [One Last God Kubera](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/kubera/list?title_no=83).

    -   I mostly read trashy romance though. They are too shameful to be revealed here. :)

-   I have a very modest Pokemon card collection. (I don't play modern Pokemon though).

-   I love Mega Man, especially the Battle Network and Zero series.

    -   I own a [book that's "worth" thousands of dollars](https://www.amazon.ca/Megaman-Zero-Official-Complete-Works/dp/1897376014)... (I paid less than a hundred for it.)

-   I have followed a strict plant-based diet since 2019. I have never experienced brain fog, except for times I could not sleep!

-   My favourite youtubers are [Catherine Klein](https://www.youtube.com/@CatherineKlein94/videos) and [Lifting Vegan Logic](https://www.youtube.com/@LiftingVeganLogic/videos).
