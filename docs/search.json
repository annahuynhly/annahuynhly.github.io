    "text": "My name is Anna Ly, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at McMaster University. I am honored to be a recipient of both the Ontario Graduate Scholarship and the Milos Novotny Fellowship. I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto.\nSince childhood, I have always been interested in probability and data visualization. I vividly recall the excitement of using crayons to colour bar plots, and that is when I knew statistics and I were a dynamic duo.\n\n\n\nI also challenged my family’s love for lotteries. Even back then, I had a sense of the gambler’s fallacy and understood that casinos were not in the business of giving money away, but I could not prove it.\nAs an undergraduate student, I have received the privilege to be a teaching assistant for an introductory probability course. I shared how to compute probabilities and expected values of winning a Lotto 649 jackpot. Unfortunately, I still can’t convince my father. :)\nI love studying statistics because it allows me to comprehend the results of many studies without being an expert! Unlike previous generations, we live in a world where data and information are easily accessible, yet opinions formed without statistical evidence prevail. Conversely, I shape my perspectives similarly to a Bayesian model: I maintain prior beliefs but am always eager to adapt and refine them in the face of compelling evidence.\nI am passionate about teaching statistics because I recognize the importance of a supportive teaching assistant. I’ve always been inspired by those who guide their students with understanding and without judgment. I am deeply grateful for the effective educators who have positively influenced my academic journey.\nSome of you may wonder why I decided to pursue McMaster for graduate school instead of UofT, or a more prestigious school. I was actually born at the McMaster Children’s Hospital. I knew from the womb that I needed to return to my birth of origin. I wanted to return so quickly I visited during my teenage years and was locked up in the mental health ward. More importantly, I wanted to have an academically pure bloodline."

    "text": "My name is Anna Ly, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at McMaster University. I am honored to be a recipient of both the Ontario Graduate Scholarship and the Milos Novotny Fellowship. I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto.\nSince childhood, I have always been interested in probability and data visualization. I vividly recall the excitement of using crayons to colour bar plots, and that is when I knew statistics and I were a dynamic duo.\n\n\n\nI also challenged my family’s love for lotteries. Even back then, I had a sense of the gambler’s fallacy and understood that casinos were not in the business of giving money away, but I could not prove it.\nAs an undergraduate student, I have received the privilege to be a teaching assistant for an introductory probability course. I shared how to compute probabilities and expected values of winning a Lotto 649 jackpot. Unfortunately, I still can’t convince my father. :)\nI love studying statistics because it allows me to comprehend the results of many studies without being an expert! Unlike previous generations, we live in a world where data and information are easily accessible, yet opinions formed without statistical evidence prevail. Conversely, I shape my perspectives similarly to a Bayesian model: I maintain prior beliefs but am always eager to adapt and refine them in the face of compelling evidence.\nI am passionate about teaching statistics because I recognize the importance of a supportive teaching assistant. I’ve always been inspired by those who guide their students with understanding and without judgment. I am deeply grateful for the effective educators who have positively influenced my academic journey.\nSome of you may wonder why I decided to pursue McMaster for graduate school instead of UofT, or a more prestigious school. I was actually born at the McMaster Children’s Hospital. I knew from the womb that I needed to return to my birth of origin. I wanted to return so quickly I visited during my teenage years and was locked up in the mental health ward. More importantly, I wanted to have an academically pure bloodline."

From my parent’s house, it takes only 45 minutes to walk to the falls. People say I’m lucky to have easy access to the magnificient falls but I’ve spent more time looking at that waterfall than studying statistics; it’s become an eyesore to me.\nMy ethnic background is a mystery, even to myself. For now I just tell people I’m Vietnamese because that’s what my parents speak at home, but it’s complicated.\n\nI don’t speak Vietnamese.\n\nI used to doodle all of the time; I hope to get back to drawing.\nI have a very modest Pokemon card collection. (I don’t play modern Pokemon though).\nI love Mega Man, especially the Battle Network and Zero series.\n\nI own a book that’s “worth” thousands of dollars… (I paid less than a hundred for it.)\n\nI have followed a strict plant-based diet since 2019.

    "section": "Q: What’s the real reason why you didn’t go to University of Toronto for graduate studies?",
    "text": "Q: What’s the real reason why you didn’t go to University of Toronto for graduate studies?\nI’m going to be blunt: I do not have a rich background and I mostly need to take care of myself, and in the future, I am expected to take care of my family financially.\nThere are many different master’s programs at UofT that are statistics-related; all of them are self-funded, even for the theoretical fields. Coupled with the fact that Greater Toronto Area is expensive, UofT is financially unviable.\nI heard they had funding at one point though, but they got rid of it in order to accept more international applicants. I am aware that I can TA and get paid, however, TAing only makes up approximately 33% of my stipend at McMaster.\nThere was one semester at UofT where I had 300 TAing hours as an undergraduate student; I developed some wrinkles. Meanwhile, I have less than 300 TAing hours at McMaster for the whole academic year (and I am being compensated well.)\nFurthermore, although the brand name does matter, going to UofT does not guarantee you success in finding a job. If I knew, with 99% certainty, that UofT would help me land an instant six-figure job; then sure. Perhaps debt is worth it. However, the course work in the statistics master’s program is focused on theory as opposed to applications.\nI also really wanted to do a thesis program instead of a course-based one! :)\nSo far, I don’t regret my decision. I am loving my time at McMaster. The professors are tech-saavy, intelligent, wise, and considerate. I have already learned so much in such a short period of time without sacrificing my mental health.\nAnother thing I love about McMaster is that the professors are supportive of all alternative career paths; they don’t care whether you go to academia or industry. They just want you to succeed in whatever you desire. Obviously, this means I may know less theorems than a UofT counterpart, but I’m confident in my coding skills."

However, they’re likely doing more elementary work, like business analysis.\nYou can make lots of money without a graduate degree, but the master’s degree just opens more doors."

    "section": "Q: Were there any benefits from switching institutions?",
    "text": "Q: Were there any benefits from switching institutions?\nIf you hang around graduate school forums you’ll eventually see some advice where it is recommended to switch schools for each degree (and for your post-doc) rather than staying at one institution multiple times.\nI notice such large differences from two different yet well respected institutions that if I ever pursue a PhD or a post-doc, I want to ensure these are all in different institutions. Ideally I should also extend this to a full-time professorship as well, but I can see myself wanting to gain tenure-ship at UTM if given the opportunity. (The reasons for this is completely personal, likely not applicable to the reader, so it will not be shared.)\nNow of course, finances are a huge consideration (i.e., if your parents already live near a good university and you don’t have to worry about rent expenses then it isn’t too bad to stay in one place). But if you’re like me and you are constantly moving to one area to another & paying rent, you should absolutely move.\nHere are some benefits that I’ve personally noticed:\n\nYou will meet professors with much different opinions and outlook on research & subject material than ones in your original institution.\n\nFor instance, one professor may not believe in using hypothesis testing but would rather use statistical coverage. Another professor may be more tech saavy than others.\nIn some sense, staying at one institution guarantees you’ll be in an echo-chamber. You don’t know what you don’t know. Going to multiple equips you with different perspectives that may inspire you in your research and academic journey.\nThere are countless of things I have noticed at McMaster compared to professors at UofT. Some of these include:\n\nFrequently collaborating with professors from other institutions. (I find that at UofT, professors tend to keep to their own faculty.)\nMassive importance in keeping up to date to technology and data science podcasts.\nDifferent mathematical notation. (It’s great to be exposed to multiple as different textbooks will use different notation anyhow.)\n\n\nMultiple alumni networks & work opportunities.\n\nNow you can participate in multiple alumni events and make more unique connections on Linkedin.\nAs a recent UofT graduate (and as someone who has collaborated with UofT professors), I get job opportunity suggestions from current UofT faculty and now from McMaster faculty as well. It’s a massive win-win!\n\nLearning what it’s like to be in a different area.\n\nNot all Ontario cities are created equal. I’ve lived (not just visited) in Niagara Falls, Mississauga, Markham, and now I’m in Hamilton. All of these cities are different and it’s good to have a change of environment to make a more educated opinion of the type of area you want to settle in the future."

    "title": "Graduate School Advice (Statistics)",
    "section": "Things to consider for choosing where to apply",
    "text": "Things to consider for choosing where to apply\nI attempted to order the below from most important to least important.\n\n1. If doing a thesis program, potential supervisors.\nYou should be looking for potential supervisors during August-November of the school year before you apply. The best faculty members will be poached around August.\nOne thing I’ve noticed at the University of Toronto is that it’s quite common for professors in the research stream to have… Around 10 PhD students under supervision. Depending on how much support and a close relationship you want to have with your supervisor, this could be a red flag.\nYou want a supervisor that’ll actually respond to emails. A couple schools have a policy where you can’t reach out to find your own supervisor (i.e., Western). However, if possible reach out to prospective supervisors and ask to get in on a meeting. If they respond, here are some very important questions to consider:\n\nHow many students have they supervised in total, and where did they end up?\n\nIf they had students that pursued industry over academia, does the professor seem proud or not care?\n\nHow many students do they supervise at a time?\n\nMore than 10 students at a time is a massive red flag.\n1-2 at a time is an awesome amount; however, these supervisors are very picky with student selection (for good reason!)\nIf possible, always try to reach out to their current and past students. You can find them on the professor’s personal website.\n\nWhat are their expectations for their students?\n\nWhen do you expect students to start working on their thesis?\nWhat do you expect students to know before starting graduate school?\nWhat does early mentorship look like (how will they train/mentor you?)\nHow much time does it take for their students to graduate?\nHow much time do they spend on a student per week?\nHow much time do you expect students to focus on their projects per week?\nWhat do students do that can make them frustrated?\nWhat kind of student does the supervisor want?\n\nWhat is their RMP score?\n\nGenuinely read the reviews; most students will rate based off of how easy it was to get an A. However, detailed ones regarding a professor’s attitude is important. Does the prof not respond well to questions or email? Is the prof dismissive to mental health concerns and accessibility?\n\nDo they like collaborating with external faculty?\n\nIt’s generally a green flag if they love collaboration; it also means you’re likely to talk to students going to a variety of different institutions as well.\n\n\n\n\n2. Prestige of faculty members\nYou generally want ones that are well liked, respected, and prestigious. You want to be surrounded by positive influences (especially in the case where you want to change supervisors as well.)\nConsider the following:\n\nWho is the most “prestigious” professor and what are they prestigious for?\nHow many professors are “prestigious”? (this can be measured a really high citation score, also known as an H-index.)\nHow are the RMP scores for the faculty overall? You should take RMP scores with a grain of salt; many studies tend to judge based on their final mark. However, some comments will provide potential green or red flags, such as attitude and temperament.)\nHow many professors are graduates from even more prestigious universities? From my personal experience, professors that have studied or did their post-doc at an ivy-league school have been good.\n\n\n\n3. Courses: they should align with your future goals.\n\nMost schools will advertise more courses than what will actually be offered year by year. Look at previous timetables (if possible) to get a realistic idea of what electives you will be able to choose from.\nAdditionally, check the mandatory courses you will have to take. They differ from school to school, and ensure you are interested in these courses. For example, the M.Sc in statistics at UofT is very math-heavy whereas other schools will emphasize applications.\nLower ranked schools, particularly those that are not part of the U15 may have statistics masters programs that are highly cross-listed with the undergraduate courses. Many might have already been covered within the bachelors statistics program at UofT.\n\nYou don’t want to take redundant courses! You want to learn.\n\nSome course syllabus will name topics you might’ve already learned in undergrad, but the focus is so different that the material may be new to you. So pay attention and try to get as many resources as possible!\n\n\n\n4. Co-op\nI did not do co-op but based off of research (aka browsing Reddit) these are the general tips or warnings:\n\nMost schools that have a co-op option don’t guarantee co-op. It’ll be easier since there will be companies targeting certain schools but you will still have to work hard for it.\nFor those who fail to get a co-op, typically students write a paper or do TA work instead! (Which you definitely don’t want to do!)\nLook at previous graduates on Linkedin and see where they did their internships; this will give you a better idea of what companies you could be working for.\n\n\n\n5. Current graduate students & alumni\n\nSee if you can find graduates and see which companies they are currently working at.\nReach out to previous or current graduate students about their experiences regarding the program.\nIt’s also good to ask whether the skills they learned were applicable to their career, and how supportive their supervisor was.\n\n\n\n6. Prestige of the University\nNotice that points 3-5 can essentially be summarized as “prestige of the program” itself.\nPrestige of a university absolutely matters and anyone who says it doesn’t is ignorant, but just because you’re going to a “brand name” university doesn’t mean the program is good. There are also measures to prestige: in undergrad, some schools are popular for business (Western), others are for co-op in engineering & mathematics (Waterloo).\nNotice that I ranked this one last. That is because in graduate school, the prestige of your supervisor, or the faculty members you will be working with, will exceed the prestige of the university (in terms of importance).\nThose inside the academia bubble may ask you questions regarding your thesis, your research area, how many papers you wrote, citations for each, grants you’ve won, conferences, you’ve attended… If you have a great supervisor, you will be able to answer these questions confidently, regardless of how prestigious the university you attended.\nNonetheless, please consider the following points:\n\nIf you’re staying in Canada, you should attend a U15 university. You want a university that focuses on research and output if you’re doing a thesis; these will generally be better funded too.\nPrestigious schools tend to be larger and will have more faculty to choose from.\nPrestigious titles attract those attracted to prestige. Hence, the professors will likely be more hardworking, qualified, etc.\n\nPrestige is great for the following:\n\nBoosts your chances of getting a career (as a professor or otherwise); it’ll stand out in your application.\nConnections. People at UofT tend to be attracted to prestige so they’re more likely to be smart, harder workers, etc. It’s always good to surround yourself with these types of people. Lots of UofT alumni also have worked for great companies compared to students in other universities (you can check on Linkedin.)\nEgo boost (although this could be a con; too much ego isn’t good for you either.)\n\nNow in terms of finding a job: everyone has their own biases. If the hiring manager is from UofT, they’ll probably be biased towards those who went to UofT. If they went to Western, they’ll probably be biased towards someone who went to Western. There’s a positive reputation amongst Waterloo graduates - after all, they do a lot of co-op terms.\nHere’s what I have noticed when I was on co-op: they exclusively hired Waterloo and UofT students as interns, however, many full-time hires came from a variety of different Canadian universities. So early career it can be a boost but it doesn’t matter in the long-term.\nSo prestige of a school is good, it does matter, but the extent in which it matters is overrated.\n\n\n7. Stipend & Funding\nIf you are well off and you or your family can cover your tuition and potential living expenses without sweating, then this section is not applicable to you. There is no shame in using resources available to you and if my father won the lottery I will happily pursue academia without any worry or stress (if he isn’t going to be stingy.)\nNow if you’re the average person then yeah, having funding to cover for tuition, housing, investments, and the occasional recreation is awesome. I had offers from 4 different universities, the one that gave the most to the least amount of funding is as follows:\nUniversity of McMaster -&gt; University of Alberta -&gt; University of Waterloo -&gt; Western University\nThat being said, this doesn’t apply to all programs and all admissions; this is from my personal experience.\nFurthermore, I didn’t even apply to UofT because I knew with 100% certainty I wouldn’t go there due to lack of funding. (I did get rejected from McGill though, but allegedly their stipend is also less than Western’s.)"

The order is: Distinguished professor -&gt; Professor -&gt; Associate Professor -&gt; Assistant Professor. Any other title implies they’re a temporary contract worker and not a professor.\nSomeone that has closely worked with you. These could be RA supervisors, independent study/ROP supervisors, etc. (Bonus tip: you don’t need to take a course under the professor either if you’ve done awesome research for them!)\nSomeone that is picky when it comes to writing reference letters for students. From my experience, picky professors are that way because they want their recommendation letters to carry weight. These professors are prestigious - and recommending a poor student could even ruin their reputation!\nIs part of a department or a professor of a field that you are applying to. For example, if you are applying to statistics then you should have statistics professors write your reference letters. It would be odd if you had a professor from another department write your letter."

    "text": "Q: What courses are useful for pursuing graduate studies in statistics or related to statistics?\nIn general, people who attend graduate school may come from a variety of different backgrounds. At the bare minimum, you should have the following courses (the course codes correspond to the courses at University of Toronto):\n\nLinear Algebra (MAT223 & MAT224 or MAT240)\nFirst & Second Year Calculus (up to Multivariate Calculus is okay.)\nReal Analysis (MAT337): for any REPUTABLE statistics program, this is the most important course. This is basically POSt but for stats majors. (If you don’t know what POSt is, it’s a UofT concept where you’re not registered into a program and you need to compete for it in second year.) Any statistics program that accepts you without real analysis must a professional program or not related to statistics at all.\nFirst year probability & mathematical statistics (STA256, STA260)\n\nAs you can tell, most of what you need is math, not stats.\nIf any particular course you’re wondering about is not on the above list, and you’re extra paranoid, just look at the courses you have to take in the master’s degree program. If you’re lucky, you may even be able to see posted requirements.\nIf the course isn’t part of the program, and the pre-requisites, then NO it is not useful."

    "text": "Q: What is the best undergraduate program to enroll to be a suitable candidate for graduate school statistics?\nIf you want to pursue statistics at UofT, or any other university which program emphasizes math instead of statistics (you can tell via looking at the academic calendar), then probably a math specialist with a statistics minor.\nI am serious; most people generally do poor in statistics due to their poor math skills. Just like how a mathematician can easily pick up economics, the same is for statistics.\nThat being said, if you’re going to a program that is a little more applied (McMaster, for instance) then you should probably do at least a statistics major. As an elective, taking statistical learning is a must and a course in bayesian statistics is awesome to have.\nAgain, you need to look at the academic calendar of the program you’re applying to, since some programs emphasize different areas of statistics."

This would’ve saved me from applying to schools without a supervisor in mind.\nWrite my letters of intent before the school semester begins to save time (you definitely don’t need any school time to do this.) Writing good letters can take a whole day, and you definitely don’t want to use ChatGPT to write it for you (trust me, most people are and it’ll make it hard for you to stand out.)\nResearch more into the specific type of research you want to do.\nRealise that if you want to do research in statistics, either do a topic in biostatistics or machine learning. Those are the only profitable fields. :)"

I’m not the primary author for most of them either, but I still contributed to way more research than most undergraduate students. I’ve also been an undergraduate teaching assistant for three years and completed my studies with a 3.92/4.00 cGPA.\nMy secret: I sacrificed everything else. I didn’t spend much time with family or friends, I almost completely stopped drawing and playing video games, I don’t really use social media.\nDue to my sacrifices, some may argue that I am not successful and my outcomes is the natural outcome of what I did.\nI am not a better person than you, or anyone who decided to slack off during their undergraduate degree. People have other priorities, such as family, friends, physical health, etc. A life of accomplishments can be a lonely one.\nNonetheless, obviously some accomplishments are good to have. It’s fine to be just be a student with a moderate cGPA (a 3.5 is great at UofT, for instance), just be a teaching assistant for a couple of courses, and maybe have two research papers. You can definitely achieve that kind of success with moderation!\nHence below I provide some practical advice to hopefully give you some direction and perhaps save some of your energy."

If you do more, you are being inefficient.”\nI didn’t really take that advice seriously, but if you did, you’re wrecking yourself. Here’s more realistic advice if you’re pursuing a math-related field: “if you’re reading a math textbook and you take less than 1 hour to read a page, you’re doing it wrong.”\nPerhaps the above isn’t applicable if you’re reading a book on how to do computations. However, if you’re reading a book on proofs, the reality is that math is a massive time sink. Forgive yourself that you cannot learn it as fast as you learned arithmetic. Give yourself as much time as possible to understand the material. I need to consistently re-read a math textbook, countless times, to understand what is going on.\nYou can never cram math. It’s not a suggestion to read a little every day, it’s a requirement.\nThat being said, a high level of intelligence would definitely lessen the time it takes to learn. However, I’m not highly intelligent, but with time I believe I can catch up. :)"

Then, my suggestion is:\n\nLook at the whole faculty list of the department you are a student of.\nLook at all of the professor’s research area and make a list of whose research aligns with yours.\nIf the professor is part of a lab, see if there’s an application process.\nIf the professor isn’t a part of a lab, read their paper (abstract, conclusion is fine) and email them asking if you could join their research. Tell them what you could offer.\n\nNote: realistically, if you are a statistics major you mostly can offer data analysis skills, which are awesome to have. If you know many statistical tests, as well as regression, you could definitely offer your skills to many different departments.

If you were to pick \\(a &gt; 1\\), then \\(P(W \\leq a) = F_{W}(a) = 1\\), which does not provide what we want.\nA common question is that when using the table of values for the \\(Z, \\chi^{2}_{n}, t_{v}, F_{n_{1}, n_{2}}\\) distributions, we typically assume \\((\\alpha/2)\\) for the area to the right (upper-tail), whereas when directly computing from the cumulative distribution function we assume \\((1 - \\alpha/2)\\) for the right (upper-tail). The reason for this is because the definition of the cumulative distribution directly implies to use the values to the left (lower-tail):\n\\[\n1-\\alpha/2 = P(X \\leq x) = F_{X}(x)\n\\]\nWhereas the textbook provides upper-tail values for the \\(Z, \\chi^{2}_{n}, t_{v}, F_{n_{1}, n_{2}}\\) distributions. Some other textbooks tend to be consistent with the cumulative distribution function.\nIf you’re coding, R is consistent with the cumulative distributions functions."

    "section": "Q: What’s the real reason why you didn’t go to University of Toronto for graduate studies?",
    "text": "Q: What’s the real reason why you didn’t go to University of Toronto for graduate studies?\nI’m going to be blunt: I do not have a rich background and I mostly need to take care of myself, and in the future, I am expected to take care of my family financially.\nThere are many different master’s programs at UofT that are statistics-related; all of them are self-funded, even for the theoretical fields. Coupled with the fact that Greater Toronto Area is expensive, UofT is financially unviable.\nI heard they had funding at one point though, but they got rid of it in order to accept more international applicants. I am aware that I can TA and get paid, however, TAing only makes up approximately 33% of my stipend at McMaster.\nThere was one semester at UofT where I had 300 TAing hours as an undergraduate student; I developed some wrinkles. Meanwhile, I have less than 300 TAing hours at McMaster for the whole academic year (and I am being compensated well.)\nFurthermore, although the brand name does matter, going to UofT does not guarantee you success in finding a job. If I knew, with 99% certainty, that UofT would help me land an instant six-figure job; then sure. Perhaps debt is worth it. However, the course work in the statistics master’s program is focused on theory as opposed to applications.\nI also really wanted to do a thesis program instead of a course-based one! :)\nSo far, I don’t regret my decision. I am loving my time at McMaster. The professors are tech-saavy, intelligent, wise, and considerate. I have already learned so much in such a short period of time without sacrificing my mental health.\nAnother thing I love about McMaster is that the professors are supportive of all alternative career paths; they don’t care whether you go to academia or industry. They just want you to succeed in whatever you desire. Obviously, this means I may know less theorems than a UofT counterpart, but I’m confident in my coding skills."

You can read this passage written by Jerry Brunner, a retired statistics professor at UofT.\nHowever, there are many people that do work with data without a statistics degree. However, they’re likely doing more elementary work, like business analysis.\nYou can make lots of money without a graduate degree, but the master’s degree just opens more doors."

    "section": "Q: Were there any benefits from switching institutions?",
    "text": "Q: Were there any benefits from switching institutions?\nIf you hang around graduate school forums you’ll eventually see some advice where it is recommended to switch schools for each degree (and for your post-doc) rather than staying at one institution multiple times.\nI notice such large differences from two different yet well respected institutions that if I ever pursue a PhD or a post-doc, I want to ensure these are all in different institutions. Ideally I should also extend this to a full-time professorship as well, but I can see myself wanting to gain tenure-ship at UTM if given the opportunity. (The reasons for this is completely personal, likely not applicable to the reader, so it will not be shared.)\nNow of course, finances are a huge consideration (i.e., if your parents already live near a good university and you don’t have to worry about rent expenses then it isn’t too bad to stay in one place). But if you’re like me and you are constantly moving to one area to another & paying rent, you should absolutely move.\nHere are some benefits that I’ve personally noticed:\n\nYou will meet professors with much different opinions and outlook on research & subject material than ones in your original institution.\n\nFor instance, one professor may not believe in using hypothesis testing but would rather use statistical coverage. Another professor may be more tech saavy than others.\nIn some sense, staying at one institution guarantees you’ll be in an echo-chamber. You don’t know what you don’t know. Going to multiple equips you with different perspectives that may inspire you in your research and academic journey.\nThere are countless of things I have noticed at McMaster compared to professors at UofT. Some of these include:\n\nFrequently collaborating with professors from other institutions. (I find that at UofT, professors tend to keep to their own faculty.)\nMassive importance in keeping up to date to technology and data science podcasts.\nDifferent mathematical notation. (It’s great to be exposed to multiple as different textbooks will use different notation anyhow.)\n\n\nMultiple alumni networks & work opportunities.\n\nNow you can participate in multiple alumni events and make more unique connections on Linkedin.\nAs a recent UofT graduate (and as someone who has collaborated with UofT professors), I get job opportunity suggestions from current UofT faculty and now from McMaster faculty as well. It’s a massive win-win!\n\nLearning what it’s like to be in a different area.\n\nNot all Ontario cities are created equal. I’ve lived (not just visited) in Niagara Falls, Mississauga, Markham, and now I’m in Hamilton. All of these cities are different and it’s good to have a change of environment to make a more educated opinion of the type of area you want to settle in the future."

    "title": "Graduate School Advice (Statistics)",
    "section": "Things to consider for choosing where to apply",
    "text": "Things to consider for choosing where to apply\nI attempted to order the below from most important to least important.\n\n1. If doing a thesis program, potential supervisors.\nYou should be looking for potential supervisors during August-November of the school year before you apply. The best faculty members will be poached around August.\nOne thing I’ve noticed at the University of Toronto is that it’s quite common for professors in the research stream to have… Around 10 PhD students under supervision. Depending on how much support and a close relationship you want to have with your supervisor, this could be a red flag.\nYou want a supervisor that’ll actually respond to emails. A couple schools have a policy where you can’t reach out to find your own supervisor (i.e., Western). However, if possible reach out to prospective supervisors and ask to get in on a meeting. If they respond, here are some very important questions to consider:\n\nHow many students have they supervised in total, and where did they end up?\n\nIf they had students that pursued industry over academia, does the professor seem proud or not care?\n\nHow many students do they supervise at a time?\n\nMore than 10 students at a time is a massive red flag.\n1-2 at a time is an awesome amount; however, these supervisors are very picky with student selection (for good reason!)\nIf possible, always try to reach out to their current and past students. You can find them on the professor’s personal website.\n\nWhat are their expectations for their students?\n\nWhen do you expect students to start working on their thesis?\nWhat do you expect students to know before starting graduate school?\nWhat does early mentorship look like (how will they train/mentor you?)\nHow much time does it take for their students to graduate?\nHow much time do they spend on a student per week?\nHow much time do you expect students to focus on their projects per week?\nWhat do students do that can make them frustrated?\nWhat kind of student does the supervisor want?\n\nWhat is their RMP score?\n\nGenuinely read the reviews; most students will rate based off of how easy it was to get an A. However, detailed ones regarding a professor’s attitude is important. Does the prof not respond well to questions or email? Is the prof dismissive to mental health concerns and accessibility?\n\nDo they like collaborating with external faculty?\n\nIt’s generally a green flag if they love collaboration; it also means you’re likely to talk to students going to a variety of different institutions as well.\n\n\n\n\n2. Prestige of faculty members\nYou generally want ones that are well liked, respected, and prestigious. You want to be surrounded by positive influences (especially in the case where you want to change supervisors as well.)\nConsider the following:\n\nWho is the most “prestigious” professor and what are they prestigious for?\nHow many professors are “prestigious”? (this can be measured a really high citation score, also known as an H-index.)\nHow are the RMP scores for the faculty overall? You should take RMP scores with a grain of salt; many studies tend to judge based on their final mark. However, some comments will provide potential green or red flags, such as attitude and temperament.)\nHow many professors are graduates from even more prestigious universities? From my personal experience, professors that have studied or did their post-doc at an ivy-league school have been good.\n\n\n\n3. Courses: they should align with your future goals.\n\nMost schools will advertise more courses than what will actually be offered year by year. Look at previous timetables (if possible) to get a realistic idea of what electives you will be able to choose from.\nAdditionally, check the mandatory courses you will have to take. They differ from school to school, and ensure you are interested in these courses. For example, the M.Sc in statistics at UofT is very math-heavy whereas other schools will emphasize applications.\nLower ranked schools, particularly those that are not part of the U15 may have statistics masters programs that are highly cross-listed with the undergraduate courses. Many might have already been covered within the bachelors statistics program at UofT.\n\nYou don’t want to take redundant courses! You want to learn.\n\nSome course syllabus will name topics you might’ve already learned in undergrad, but the focus is so different that the material may be new to you. So pay attention and try to get as many resources as possible!\n\n\n\n4. Co-op\nI did not do co-op but based off of research (aka browsing Reddit) these are the general tips or warnings:\n\nMost schools that have a co-op option don’t guarantee co-op. It’ll be easier since there will be companies targeting certain schools but you will still have to work hard for it.\nFor those who fail to get a co-op, typically students write a paper or do TA work instead! (Which you definitely don’t want to do!)\nLook at previous graduates on Linkedin and see where they did their internships; this will give you a better idea of what companies you could be working for.\n\n\n\n5. Current graduate students & alumni\n\nSee if you can find graduates and see which companies they are currently working at.\nReach out to previous or current graduate students about their experiences regarding the program.\nIt’s also good to ask whether the skills they learned were applicable to their career, and how supportive their supervisor was.\n\n\n\n6. Prestige of the University\nNotice that points 3-5 can essentially be summarized as “prestige of the program” itself.\nPrestige of a university absolutely matters and anyone who says it doesn’t is ignorant, but just because you’re going to a “brand name” university doesn’t mean the program is good. There are also measures to prestige: in undergrad, some schools are popular for business (Western), others are for co-op in engineering & mathematics (Waterloo).\nNotice that I ranked this one last. That is because in graduate school, the prestige of your supervisor, or the faculty members you will be working with, will exceed the prestige of the university (in terms of importance).\nThose inside the academia bubble may ask you questions regarding your thesis, your research area, how many papers you wrote, citations for each, grants you’ve won, conferences, you’ve attended… If you have a great supervisor, you will be able to answer these questions confidently, regardless of how prestigious the university you attended.\nNonetheless, please consider the following points:\n\nIf you’re staying in Canada, you should attend a U15 university. You want a university that focuses on research and output if you’re doing a thesis; these will generally be better funded too.\nPrestigious schools tend to be larger and will have more faculty to choose from.\nPrestigious titles attract those attracted to prestige. Hence, the professors will likely be more hardworking, qualified, etc.\n\nPrestige is great for the following:\n\nBoosts your chances of getting a career (as a professor or otherwise); it’ll stand out in your application.\nConnections. People at UofT tend to be attracted to prestige so they’re more likely to be smart, harder workers, etc. It’s always good to surround yourself with these types of people. Lots of UofT alumni also have worked for great companies compared to students in other universities (you can check on Linkedin.)\nEgo boost (although this could be a con; too much ego isn’t good for you either.)\n\nNow in terms of finding a job: everyone has their own biases. If the hiring manager is from UofT, they’ll probably be biased towards those who went to UofT. If they went to Western, they’ll probably be biased towards someone who went to Western. There’s a positive reputation amongst Waterloo graduates - after all, they do a lot of co-op terms.\nHere’s what I have noticed when I was on co-op: they exclusively hired Waterloo and UofT students as interns, however, many full-time hires came from a variety of different Canadian universities. So early career it can be a boost but it doesn’t matter in the long-term.\nSo prestige of a school is good, it does matter, but the extent in which it matters is overrated.\n\n\n7. Stipend & Funding\nIf you are well off and you or your family can cover your tuition and potential living expenses without sweating, then this section is not applicable to you. There is no shame in using resources available to you and if my father won the lottery I will happily pursue academia without any worry or stress (if he isn’t going to be stingy.)\nNow if you’re the average person then yeah, having funding to cover for tuition, housing, investments, and the occasional recreation is awesome. I had offers from 4 different universities, the one that gave the most to the least amount of funding is as follows:\nUniversity of McMaster -&gt; University of Alberta -&gt; University of Waterloo -&gt; Western University\nThat being said, this doesn’t apply to all programs and all admissions; this is from my personal experience.\nFurthermore, I didn’t even apply to UofT because I knew with 100% certainty I wouldn’t go there due to lack of funding. (I did get rejected from McGill though, but allegedly their stipend is also less than Western’s.)"

    "text": "Q: Who should be writing my reference letters?\nMost graduate school programs require 2-3 reference letters. A lot of professors tend to have different criteria for writing a letter - the first challenge is to find professors that enthusiastically agree.\nIf any of the following occurs:\n\nYou’re trying to send more than one email asking for a recommendation letter.\nThe professor shows any hesitancy to write it (i.e. they don’t know you well, wanting higher grades…)\n\nThen don’t have them write your reference letter. You are not allowed to see the reference letter, and you’ll likely get a bad one.\nEach professor has their own requirements: some only care about a high grade and recognising their face, and some reserve it for those they have done research with. You will just need to ask.\nIf you are fortunate to have many professors that are willing to write reference letters, you want a professor that has the following traits:\n\nHigh rank & experienced. The order is: Distinguished professor -&gt; Professor -&gt; Associate Professor -&gt; Assistant Professor. Any other title implies they’re a temporary contract worker and not a professor.\nSomeone that has closely worked with you. These could be RA supervisors, independent study/ROP supervisors, etc. (Bonus tip: you don’t need to take a course under the professor either if you’ve done awesome research for them!)\nSomeone that is picky when it comes to writing reference letters for students. From my experience, picky professors are that way because they want their recommendation letters to carry weight. These professors are prestigious - and recommending a poor student could even ruin their reputation!\nIs part of a department or a professor of a field that you are applying to. For example, if you are applying to statistics then you should have statistics professors write your reference letters. It would be odd if you had a professor from another department write your letter."

    "text": "Q: What courses are useful for pursuing graduate studies in statistics or related to statistics?\nIn general, people who attend graduate school may come from a variety of different backgrounds. At the bare minimum, you should have the following courses (the course codes correspond to the courses at University of Toronto):\n\nLinear Algebra (MAT223 & MAT224 or MAT240)\nFirst & Second Year Calculus (up to Multivariate Calculus is okay.)\nReal Analysis (MAT337): for any REPUTABLE statistics program, this is the most important course. This is basically POSt but for stats majors. (If you don’t know what POSt is, it’s a UofT concept where you’re not registered into a program and you need to compete for it in second year.) Any statistics program that accepts you without real analysis must a professional program or not related to statistics at all.\nFirst year probability & mathematical statistics (STA256, STA260)\n\nAs you can tell, most of what you need is math, not stats.\nIf any particular course you’re wondering about is not on the above list, and you’re extra paranoid, just look at the courses you have to take in the master’s degree program. If you’re lucky, you may even be able to see posted requirements.\nIf the course isn’t part of the program, and the pre-requisites, then NO it is not useful."

Just like how a mathematician can easily pick up economics, the same is for statistics.\nThat being said, if you’re going to a program that is a little more applied (McMaster, for instance) then you should probably do at least a statistics major. As an elective, taking statistical learning is a must and a course in bayesian statistics is awesome to have.\nAgain, you need to look at the academic calendar of the program you’re applying to, since some programs emphasize different areas of statistics."

This would’ve saved me from applying to schools without a supervisor in mind.\nWrite my letters of intent before the school semester begins to save time (you definitely don’t need any school time to do this.) Writing good letters can take a whole day, and you definitely don’t want to use ChatGPT to write it for you (trust me, most people are and it’ll make it hard for you to stand out.)\nResearch more into the specific type of research you want to do.\nRealise that if you want to do research in statistics, either do a topic in biostatistics or machine learning. Those are the only profitable fields. :)"

I’m not the primary author for most of them either, but I still contributed to way more research than most undergraduate students. I’ve also been an undergraduate teaching assistant for three years and completed my studies with a 3.92/4.00 cGPA.\nMy secret: I sacrificed everything else. I didn’t spend much time with family or friends, I almost completely stopped drawing and playing video games, I don’t really use social media.\nDue to my sacrifices, some may argue that I am not successful and my outcomes is the natural outcome of what I did.\nI am not a better person than you, or anyone who decided to slack off during their undergraduate degree. People have other priorities, such as family, friends, physical health, etc. A life of accomplishments can be a lonely one.\nNonetheless, obviously some accomplishments are good to have. It’s fine to be just be a student with a moderate cGPA (a 3.5 is great at UofT, for instance), just be a teaching assistant for a couple of courses, and maybe have two research papers. You can definitely achieve that kind of success with moderation!\nHence below I provide some practical advice to hopefully give you some direction and perhaps save some of your energy."

If you do more, you are being inefficient.”\nI didn’t really take that advice seriously, but if you did, you’re wrecking yourself. Here’s more realistic advice if you’re pursuing a math-related field: “if you’re reading a math textbook and you take less than 1 hour to read a page, you’re doing it wrong.”\nPerhaps the above isn’t applicable if you’re reading a book on how to do computations. However, if you’re reading a book on proofs, the reality is that math is a massive time sink. Forgive yourself that you cannot learn it as fast as you learned arithmetic. Give yourself as much time as possible to understand the material. I need to consistently re-read a math textbook, countless times, to understand what is going on.\nYou can never cram math. It’s not a suggestion to read a little every day, it’s a requirement.\nThat being said, a high level of intelligence would definitely lessen the time it takes to learn. However, I’m not highly intelligent, but with time I believe I can catch up. :)"

Then, my suggestion is:\n\nLook at the whole faculty list of the department you are a student of.\nLook at all of the professor’s research area and make a list of whose research aligns with yours.\nIf the professor is part of a lab, see if there’s an application process.\nIf the professor isn’t a part of a lab, read their paper (abstract, conclusion is fine) and email them asking if you could join their research. Tell them what you could offer.\n\nNote: realistically, if you are a statistics major you mostly can offer data analysis skills, which are awesome to have. If you know many statistical tests, as well as regression, you could definitely offer your skills to many different departments.
