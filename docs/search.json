    "text": "My name is Anna Ly, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at McMaster University. I am honored to be a recipient of both the Ontario Graduate Scholarship and the Milos Novotny Fellowship. I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto.\nSince childhood, I have always been interested in probability and data visualization. I vividly recall the excitement of using crayons to colour bar plots, and that is when I knew statistics and I were a dynamic duo.\n\n\n\nI also challenged my family’s love for lotteries. Even back then, I had a sense of the gambler’s fallacy and understood that casinos were not in the business of giving money away, but I could not prove it.\nAs an undergraduate student, I have received the privilege to be a teaching assistant for an introductory probability course. I shared how to compute probabilities and expected values of winning a Lotto 649 jackpot. Unfortunately, I still can’t convince my father. :)\nI love studying statistics because it allows me to comprehend the results of many studies without being an expert! Unlike previous generations, we live in a world where data and information are easily accessible, yet opinions formed without statistical evidence prevail. Conversely, I shape my perspectives similarly to a Bayesian model: I maintain prior beliefs but am always eager to adapt and refine them in the face of compelling evidence.\nI am passionate about teaching statistics because I recognize the importance of a supportive teaching assistant. I’ve always been inspired by those who guide their students with understanding and without judgment. I am deeply grateful for the effective educators who have positively influenced my academic journey.\nSome of you may wonder why I decided to pursue McMaster for graduate school instead of UofT, or a more prestigious school. I was actually born at the McMaster Children’s Hospital. I knew from the womb that I needed to return to my birth of origin. I wanted to return so quickly I visited during my teenage years and was locked up in the mental health ward. More importantly, I wanted to have an academically pure bloodline."

    "text": "My name is Anna Ly, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at McMaster University. I am honored to be a recipient of both the Ontario Graduate Scholarship and the Milos Novotny Fellowship. I finished my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto.\nSince childhood, I have always been interested in probability and data visualization. I vividly recall the excitement of using crayons to colour bar plots, and that is when I knew statistics and I were a dynamic duo.\n\n\n\nI also challenged my family’s love for lotteries. Even back then, I had a sense of the gambler’s fallacy and understood that casinos were not in the business of giving money away, but I could not prove it.\nAs an undergraduate student, I have received the privilege to be a teaching assistant for an introductory probability course. I shared how to compute probabilities and expected values of winning a Lotto 649 jackpot. Unfortunately, I still can’t convince my father. :)\nI love studying statistics because it allows me to comprehend the results of many studies without being an expert! Unlike previous generations, we live in a world where data and information are easily accessible, yet opinions formed without statistical evidence prevail. Conversely, I shape my perspectives similarly to a Bayesian model: I maintain prior beliefs but am always eager to adapt and refine them in the face of compelling evidence.\nI am passionate about teaching statistics because I recognize the importance of a supportive teaching assistant. I’ve always been inspired by those who guide their students with understanding and without judgment. I am deeply grateful for the effective educators who have positively influenced my academic journey.\nSome of you may wonder why I decided to pursue McMaster for graduate school instead of UofT, or a more prestigious school. I was actually born at the McMaster Children’s Hospital. I knew from the womb that I needed to return to my birth of origin. I wanted to return so quickly I visited during my teenage years and was locked up in the mental health ward. More importantly, I wanted to have an academically pure bloodline."

    "text": "Fun Facts About Me\nIn this section you’ll learn that I have a life outside of studying and teaching statistics. (The horror, I know.)\n\nI grew up in Niagara Falls, Canada. From my parent’s house, it takes only 45 minutes to walk to the falls. People say I’m lucky to have easy access to the magnificient falls but I’ve spent more time looking at that waterfall than studying statistics; it’s become an eyesore to me.\nMy ethnic background is a mystery, even to myself. For now I just tell people I’m Vietnamese because that’s what my parents speak at home, but it’s complicated.\n\nI don’t speak Vietnamese.\n\nI used to doodle all of the time; I hope to get back to drawing.\nI have a very modest Pokemon card collection. (I don’t play modern Pokemon though).\nI love Mega Man, especially the Battle Network and Zero series.\n\nI own a book that’s “worth” thousands of dollars… (I paid less than a hundred for it.)\n\nI have followed a strict plant-based diet since 2019. I have never experienced brain fog, except for times I could not sleep!\nMy favourite youtubers are Catherine Klein and Lifting Vegan Logic."

There’s even another “Anna Ly” in my extended family… There were multiple Anna Ly’s at the University of Toronto. Sometimes students would email the incorrect one and be upset that I didn’t respond to their email. Anyways, I could vent about this all day. Here are my actual profiles:\n\nGithub\nLinkedin\nGoogle Scholar\nStackoverflow (all I do is ask questions.)\n\nIf the username so happens to include “Huynh” in the middle (i.e., annahuynhly) then it’s more likely to be me. It is a common misconception that “Huynh” is my middle name. I have no middle name; it’s my mom’s last name."

    "section": "Q: What’s the real reason why you didn’t go to University of Toronto for graduate studies?",
    "text": "Q: What’s the real reason why you didn’t go to University of Toronto for graduate studies?\nI’m going to be blunt: I do not have a rich background and I mostly need to take care of myself, and in the future, I am expected to take care of my family financially.\nThere are many different master’s programs at UofT that are statistics-related; all of them are self-funded, even for the theoretical fields. Coupled with the fact that Greater Toronto Area is expensive, UofT is financially unviable.\nI heard they had funding at one point though, but they got rid of it in order to accept more international applicants. I am aware that I can TA and get paid, however, TAing only makes up approximately 33% of my stipend at McMaster.\nThere was one semester at UofT where I had 300 TAing hours as an undergraduate student; I developed some wrinkles. Meanwhile, I have less than 300 TAing hours at McMaster for the whole academic year (and I am being compensated well.)\nFurthermore, although the brand name does matter, going to UofT does not guarantee you success in finding a job. If I knew, with 99% certainty, that UofT would help me land an instant six-figure job; then sure. Perhaps debt is worth it. However, the course work in the statistics master’s program is focused on theory as opposed to applications.\nI also really wanted to do a thesis program instead of a course-based one! :)\nSo far, I don’t regret my decision. I am loving my time at McMaster. The professors are tech-saavy, intelligent, wise, and considerate. I have already learned so much in such a short period of time without sacrificing my mental health.\nAnother thing I love about McMaster is that the professors are supportive of all alternative career paths; they don’t care whether you go to academia or industry. They just want you to succeed in whatever you desire. Obviously, this means I may know less theorems than a UofT counterpart, but I’m confident in my coding skills."

You can read this passage written by Jerry Brunner, a retired statistics professor at UofT.\nHowever, there are many people that do work with data without a statistics degree. However, they’re likely doing more elementary work, like business analysis.\nYou can make lots of money without a graduate degree, but the master’s degree just opens more doors.\n[incomplete]"
