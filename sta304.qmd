I have been a teaching assistant for [STA304](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/sta304h5) (Surveys, Sampling and Observational Data) under the supervision of [Luai Al Labadi](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=DIin_xEAAAAJ&hl=en) during Fall 2022 and Fall 2023. In particular, I was in charge of overseeing and faciliating the group projects within the course.

Students are tasked to create surveys, collect data, clean data, perform data analysis, write a report, and present their results.

I've personally observed that many students that take STA304 don't know much about hypothesis testing and do not know as a code. Hence, I wrote a detailed review of of topics they should know as well as some additional data analysis methods. The guide can be found below:
